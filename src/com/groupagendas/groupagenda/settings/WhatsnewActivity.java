		String text = "<p>How to use</p><p>Register and create Profile</p><p>To begin, please create a user account via the login icon. The application is then free to be used</p><p>For both use as an app and on the internet, a basic amount of user information is needed. (See asterisked fields)</p><p>Beyond this, information is optional. However, the more information provided the more powerful GroupAgenda gets.</p><p>For example to be used internationally countries and timezones are needed to recalculate event times to local times.Other features within Groupagenda will rely on information you provide to target events that are nearby and interesting to you.</p><p>For App use, the phone number is required. The telephone number will also be used to make connections between your contacts who have your telephone number but dont have your email with the use of your telephone the connection can be made.</p><p>All data entered via the website or phone application remains your property. Only you can decide who to share your data with.</p><p>Contacts</p><p>To create contacts, navigate to the adress book page using the contacts tab. From here, contacts and groups can be created manually or imported from either csv spreadsheets, For Yahoo or Google accounts we created an automated upload of contacts.</p><p>Within the contact menu, you are also able to view the agendas of your contacts and organise your events so there are no double bookings.</p><p>Creating Events</p><p>Using the events tab, Groupagendas allows the unique creation of different types of events to tailor to every need. There are 5 types of event available:<br>1.Private Note: This is an event that is only viewable to you. Regardless of your shared agendas, this will be hidden. It is designed to make a useful reminder for you and allow a personal schedule to be created. The note can be used for to do list and reminders.<br>2.Shared Note: This is a note to inform all people in your shared agendas where you area and when you are unavailable. Using shared notes, family clashes and organised meetings will be able to clash!<br>Note: The note feature does not send out reminders or invitations. It is there to remind or be viewed by those you allow to view.<br>3.Shared Event: Shared event are those for you to invite friends to attend at a set date, time and place. On a shared event, time zones will not be recalculated. Shared agendas are visual to all you share an agenda with.<br>4.Telephone Event: This is an event for when you plan a phone or conference call with a colleague, friend or family member. Exclusive to groupagenda, is the ability for a telephone event to be recalculated to the different time zones of the users.<br>5.Open Events: These are events available for any to view. Perfect for informing contacts where you will be during festivals or big events. Open events will be available for everyone who have your contact details.</p><p>Also available: Icons and colours can be assigned to allow easy filtering of different parts of your schedule.</p><p>During registration, users must add their information in the fields required. Mandatory fields are highlighted. To use group agendas on your phone, the number must also be supplied. This will create your unique profile.</p><p>As the programme develops we may ask you for more necessary information, but this will be to better our service for your benefit. You will always decide if wether to add information or not.</p><p>Here is an example just to make things clear:</p><p>To view open events the following fields are required:</p><p>Country and City</p><p>Groupagendas will show you public events in your local area.</p><p>You are in complete control, you set the agenda and you decide what information is visable to others.</p><p>Invitations, Event and Notes</p><p>Events:</p><p>Events can be created by yourself or other users. Your created events can then be managed under the my events tab. Events you are attending can be managed under accepted events. It couldn't be simpler.</p><p>You can also use the chat box to communicate with other members of the event, so you can organise the little details, such as what to bring or who is driving.</p><p>Open events are generated by your contacts. If theres a festival your friend is attending, they simply have to create an open event and it can be seen they are going. It is also a good way of meeting new people going to the event. Open events can also be used by organisation which you joined to communicate bigger activities.</p><p>Notes are for the day to day running of your life.</p><p>Typical uses are for shopping lists, or to do lists. Private notes are only visible to your agenda, so you can keep on track of day to day life. Public notes are to keep your close friends or contacts informed you are going for a holiday.</p><p>Exception: Conference call</p><p>You can also add notes to your shared agenda. This can be used to inform friends, family and specified contacts when you are not available.</p><p>You can also create a joint note. This is to remember about tasks where no event/meeting is involved, such as a joint �to do� list or converence call over skype. This will not be visable to anyone else other that yourself and the contact you have added.</p><p>Invitations</p>Based on question of users we like to clarify the difference between invitations and Events:</p><p>You will recieve invitations to events from your contacts, be it social, sporting or work related. Invitations are shown in your agenda, providing all the necessary information and allowing you to accept or decline the invite. Invites will read as follows:</p><p>New: With these invitations you haven�t made a decision what you will do.</p>Pending: You have communicated that there is a chance you will join the event.</p>Rejected: Unfortunately you can�t join the event.</p><p>If you change your mind at the last minute it is not a problem, simply update groupagenda and it will notify the host.</p><p>Shared Agenda</p><p>Full view</p><p>If your contact opens the shared agenda he can see all meeting you have add in the agenda. We would like to point out that the option should be used wisely and only for family and very close contacts. Note which don�t have the shared qualification are not visual. The user will always have the possibilities to notes and shared</p>Full View</p><p>By opening a shared agenda, your contacts can see all your meetings. You should chose wisely about who you share your whole agenda with. We suggest this is only for family and very close contacts. Notes that are not classified as shared are not viewable. There is always the possibility to edit your sharing settings at anytime and you ca grant the excess for short periods of time just to plan the meeting and close your agenda for the future.</p><p>Limited View</p><p>Contacts can�t see the specifics of your activities. Your activities appear in grey so the contact knows when you are unavailable. When the contact joins the same event then he / she can see the details.</p><p>No view</p><p>This is the default setting. No one can enter your agenda under this setting.</p><p>Icons and use of colours</p><p>When looking at the direct overview of your agenda the use of icons and events can be helpful. Icons can be added for specific events for clarity, and different types of events listed in different colours. Icons can be set on the website and the mobile app. Icons are directly added to your event based on keywords in the main title.</p><p>For example, the user added the word football in the title, so the football icon will be automatically added to the agenda next to the title.</p><p>The same procedure can be used to add the colours for special events / notes</p><p>To simplify agenda viewing, events, notes and invitations can be divided using filters into colours and icons to make quick, easy and clear viewing</p><p>All new invitations where you have not made your decision will appear in red on your agenda to remind you of your pending decision.</p> <p>Sports Manager Setup not availible on app�s</p><p>This view can be used by a sports or society team leader to aid with the planning of team training, social events and matches.</p><p>Through this view, Groupagenda can be used as an adminstritave tool for sports groups. Training, matches and events are fixed by the administrator. These are then viewable by all sports group members and the construction of a team can be made. They are then able to view and either accept or decline events. The number of spaces available can be limited, and roles can be set up within the team such as player positions, captains, drivers, or team leaders.</p><p>All information regarding a sports or social event can be made available to the members of this club and hidden to all others. Reminders about events are also available to regularly inform members of upcoming fixtures</p><p>Organisations.</p><p>For organisation we offer a special service to share information to your. Organisation who have public data to share can contact the groupagendas and request upload of special data which all users can download to their agenda. The information needs to be of interest to a big group of users.</p><p>An example of information we as groupagendas like to publish are the data of euro 2012 championship matches, data for national sports leagues, concert data, �theather, National holidays and religions holidays dates. This information will be distrubed for free after control and upload by the groupagendas team.</p><p>For organisation who like to communicate data to their members we offer the ability to create an organisation to distrube the information only to those who are member of the organisation. Difference type of organisation could benefit from this service.</p><p>Sport unions can communicate match data and bigger events to their members, for companies it is possible to communicate personal planning with potential safeguards and passwords. Personel can be informed of their workschedules instantly into thier personal online agenda. This feature is perfectin combination with shared agendas for employees who travel and need to inform there work schedule with friends and family.</p><p>For larger organisations with over 1.000 members please contact groupagensas to discuss options and support for uploading data, including password protected data.</p>";
